# Theme Toggle Fix Implementation Log

## Objective Completion Status

- ✅ Restricted theme toggle visibility to only appear on index page (Home)
- ✅ Enhanced theme toggling functionality with improved code organization
- ✅ Added proper CodeRef2 tagging for the theme toggle component

## Changes Made

### 1. Theme Toggle Visibility Restriction

The theme toggle button is now only visible on the index page/HomePage. This was achieved by:

- Keeping the theme toggle button only on index.html
- Including theme-toggle.js script only on the index page
- Using a path check in JavaScript to only initialize the toggle on the index page:
  ```javascript
  // Only initialize theme toggle on the index page
  const path = window.location.pathname;
  if (path.endsWith('index.html') || path === '/minimalist-template/' || path === '/') {
      initThemeToggle();
  }
  ```

### 2. Theme Functionality Improvements

- Added proper theme toggling with improved state management
- Created a `setTheme()` helper function to centralize theme changing logic
- Implemented proper event dispatching for theme changes
- Enhanced button text updates based on current theme state

### 3. CodeRef2 Tagging Updates

- Added the `@C/ui/ThemeToggle` tag to the theme toggle functionality
- Updated CodeRef2 index documentation to include the new component reference
- Improved code documentation with JSDoc style comments

## Files Modified

1. `js/main.js` - Enhanced theme toggle functionality with new `setTheme()` helper
2. `js/theme-toggle.js` - Updated to use centralized theme logic and only load on index page
3. `index.html` - Added theme-toggle.js script inclusion 
4. `home.html` - Added comment to clarify why theme-toggle.js is not included
5. `coderef-index.md` - Updated component documentation to reflect multiple file implementation

## Testing Results

- ✅ Theme toggle only visible on index page/HomePage
- ✅ Theme changes instantly and persists across page reloads
- ✅ Theme is consistently applied across all pages
